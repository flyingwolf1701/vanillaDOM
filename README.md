practice building a website using just DOM manipulation. Working with an empty html page.

Goal: Build a rudamentary bug tracking app. 

1) index.js, style.css, index.html. attach js and css to html.
2) Set up main container
  - created a function that sets attributes so I can have as many as I need
  - I wonder if I can create a function that will build most of an element for me... yes, yes I can!
